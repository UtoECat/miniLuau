Luau 
====

Luau (lowercase u, /ˈlu.aʊ/) is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable scripting language derived from [Lua](https://lua.org).

This is not original Luau repository.
Visit [Original Luau repository](https://github.com/Roblox/luau) for more information about LuaU.

This repository hosts source code for the VM, LUAAPI and COMPILER implementation, to make it easy to embend in your projects.

Also it has optional luau-test utility, to check if compilation is done correctly and API working as intended.

The documentation portion of this repository can be viewed at https://luau-lang.org/

# What is this MiniLuau about?

This is a bit changed Luau distribution :
- make system is simplified (a bit .\_.)
- unneded sources to embend are removed (Native Codegen, Analyzers...)
- and that's it.

# Building

On all platforms, you can use CMake to run the following commands to build Luau compiler and VM libraries from source:

```sh
mkdir cmake && cd cmake
cmake ..
```

Alternatively, on Linux/macOS you can use `make` :

```sh
make
```

Anytiing is builded with best compiler flags possible by default (release).
You can optionally add `-flto` compiler and linker flags to luau + your whole project to get more optimised binary in result.

To integrate Luau into your CMake application projects as a library, at the minimum you'll need to depend on `Luau.VM` project. In case you need to load lua code, not only bytecode, `Lua.Compiler` should be added as dependency.

From there you need to create a new Luau state (using Lua 5.x API such as `lua_newstate`), compile source to bytecode and load it into the VM like this:

```cpp
#include "lua.h"
#include "luacode.h"

// ...

size_t bytecodeSize = 0;
char* bytecode = luau_compile(source, strlen(source), NULL, &bytecodeSize);
int result = luau_load(L, chunkname, bytecode, bytecodeSize, 0);
free(bytecode);

if (result == 0)
    return 1; /* return chunk main function */

// ...
```

For more details about the use of host API you currently need to consult [Lua 5.x API](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#3). Luau closely tracks that API but has a few deviations, such as the need to compile source separately (which is important to be able to deploy VM without a compiler), or lack of `__gc` support (use `lua_newuserdatadtor` instead).

To gain advantage of many performance improvements it's **highly recommended to use `safeenv` feature**, which *sandboxes individual scripts' global tables from each other* as well as *protects builtin libraries from monkey-patching*. For this to work you need to call `luaL_sandbox` for the global state and `luaL_sandboxthread` for each new script's execution thread.

# Dependencies

Luau uses C++ as its implementation language. The runtime requires C++11, whereas the compiler and analysis components require C++17. It should build without issues using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or later, or gcc-7 or clang-7 or later.

Other than the STL/CRT, Luau library components don't have external dependencies. 

# License

When Luau is integrated into external projects, we ask to honor the license agreement and include Luau attribution into the user-facing product documentation. The attribution using [Luau logo](https://github.com/Roblox/luau/blob/master/docs/logo.svg) is also encouraged.
